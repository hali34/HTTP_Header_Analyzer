# HTTP_Header_Analyzer
The HTTPRequestAnalyzer program is a Python tool designed to analyze HTTP request files for compliance with best practices, security measures, and proper formatting. Using the re library for regular expression processing, the program parses critical components of an HTTP request, including the method, path, protocol, headers, and body. It evaluates headers like Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, and X-Content-Type-Options to identify missing or improperly configured security measures and detects whether HTTPS is enforced based on the Referer header. Additionally, it flags uncommon HTTP methods and provides actionable recommendations to improve the request's adherence to security standards. This tool is valuable for developers and security analysts seeking to enhance the security and robustness of HTTP communications.
